-	Peel, clean the potatoes in water and cut them in small thin pieces
-	Put salt on the potatoes
-	Fry/poach the potatoes for about 20'. Meanwhile, blend the eggs in a bowl and add salt.
-	Drain the potatoes and put them into the egg mix. Leave it for about 10-20'. Add more egg mix if too dry
-	Fry the mix of potatoes and eggs (meddium-high heat) in a nonstick pan with a little bit of olive oil. Turn it with a plate after 2-3' (when the edges start to produce bubbles) and fry the other side for another 2-3'. 


Advices: If the potatoe is "sweet" then put quite a bit of salt. (you can always add more when mixed in the bowl with the eggs)
	 The longer you leave the mix of eggs and potatoes resting, the better ( 30' max). 
	 When you dry the mix of eggs and potatoes, if it smells like smoke/burned, its already late. Better to eat it a bit raw than overcooked (I use to eat from the bowl of the mix while resting :) )
